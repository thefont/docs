# Roku Channel Manifest

### Overview
The root level of all Roku Channels must contain a `manifest` file containing important attributes for the application. These attributes include the name and version number of the application, the channel icon, splash screen image, etc.

**Sections:**
* [Manifest Guidelines](#manifest-guidelines)
* [Required Attributes](#required-attributes)
* [Optional Attributes](#optional-attributes)
  * [Splash Screen Attributes](#splash-screen-attributes)
  * [Graphics Scaling Attributes](#graphics-scaling-attributes)
  * [Launch Requirement Attributes](#launch-requirement-attributes)
  * [DRM Attributes](#drm-attributes)
  * [Special Purpose Attributes](#special-purpose-attributes)
* [Screensaver Attributes](#screensaver-attributes)
  * [Required Screensaver Attributes](#required-screensaver-attributes)
  * [Optional Screensaver Attributes](#optional-screensaver-attributes)
* [Legacy Attributes (Deprecated)](#legacy-attributes-deprecated)

---

## Manifest Guidelines

* Each attribute is on a separate line, and has the form `name=value`
* Each `name=value` pair must end with a newline character, or it may not be parsed by the firmware
* The last line must end with a newline character
* Empty lines are ignored
* Lines beginning with a '#' (number sign) are comment lines and are ignored
* All graphics files specified in the manifest file should be included in the `images` directory.
* The URI to set the path to the files should use the `pkg:` resource prefix, such as `pkg:/images/splash-screen.png`.

## Required Attributes
These are the minimum attributes required for every Roku channel:

| Attribute | Type   | Description | Sample manifest entry | Specification |
| --------- | ------ | ----------- | --------------------- | ------------- |
| `title`   | string | name of the channel | `title=Roku Media Player` ||
| `major_version` | integer | major portion of channel version | `major_version=1` ||
| `minor_version` | integer | minor portion of channel version | `minor_version=2` ||
| `build_version` | integer | build number | `build_version=150` ||
| `mm_icon_focus_hd` | string | local URI for the channel icon | `mm_icon_focus_hd=pkg:/images/channel-icon.png` | 540x405
| `splash_screen_fhd` | string | local URI for the splash screen displayed when the channel is launched | `splash_screen_fhd=pkg:/images/splash-screen.png` | 1920x1080

## Optional Attributes
The following categories of attributes are optional:

### Splash Screen Attributes
| Attribute | Type   | Description | Sample manifest entry | Specification |
| --------- | ------ | ----------- | --------------------- | ------------- |
| `splash_color` | hex value | background color to use if the splash screen image is not full screen | `splash_color=#121212`
| `splash_min_time`<sup>1</sup> | integer | minimum amount of time (in milliseconds) to display the splash screen | `splash_min_time=1500`
| `splash_screen_hd`<sup>2</sup> | string | local URI for the HD splash screen | `splash_screen_hd=pkg:/images/splash-screen.png` | 1280x720
| `splash_rsg_optimization` | integer | Set this attribute to remove the black screen flash issue in SceneGraph channels. This is only applicable for SceneGraph channels and only if the first screen is a SceneGraph component. <br><br>_Available since firmware version 7.6_ | `splash_rsg_optimization=1`


> <sup>1</sup> If no value is specified, then 1600 (1.6 seconds) is used. If 0 is specified, then there is no default time, so the splash screen disappears as soon as the application displays its first screen. (This may result in the appearance of flashing, if your application shows its first screen quickly).

> <sup>2</sup> The FHD splash screen image is scaled down for HD display mode but this attribute can be used to specify a resolution-specific splash screen image.

### Graphics Scaling Attributes

| Attribute | Type   | Description | Sample manifest entry |
| --------- | ------ | ----------- | --------------------- |
| `ui_resolutions`<sup>1</sup> | comma separated values | A comma-separated list of up to three strings that identify the UI resolutions the application has been designed to support. | `ui_resolutions=sd,hd,fhd`
| `uri_resolution_autosub`<sup>2</sup> | comma separated values | Provides a flexible way to specify graphical image URIs that are automatically modified to replace a specified string with a string that gets a resolution-specific graphical image. | `uri_resolution_autosub=$$RES$$,SD,720p,1080p`

> <sup>1</sup> The default value is `sd,hd`. <br>`sd`	Applications designed for standard definition 720x480 <br> `hd` Applications designed for high definition 1280x720 <br> `fhd` Applications designed for full high definition 1920x1080

> <sup>2</sup> The attribute value is a comma-separated list of four strings that specify the string to be replaced along with the replacement strings for SD, HD and FHD resolutions. <br><br>For example, suppose the manifest includes this line: uri_resolution_autosub=$$RES$$,SD,720p,1080p And the Roku player supports full high-definition resolution. <br><br>Then if the application specifies a URI of: http://www.roku.com/testChannel/assets/$$RES$$/rokuTV.jpg At runtime that URI will be modified to: http://www.roku.com/testChannel/assets/1080p/rokuTV.jpg and the application will get the full-high definition version of the graphical image in the specified directory.

### Launch Requirement Attributes

| Attribute | Type   | Description | Sample manifest entry |
| --------- | ------ | ----------- | --------------------- |
| `requires_audiometadata` | integer | The roAudioMetadata component requires the use of a dynamically loaded library that is not part of the initially booted image. Therefore, an entry must be added to the manifest of any applications that use the roAudioMetadata component so that it can be loaded when the channel is launched. | `requires_audiometadata=1`
| `requires_gaming_remote` | integer | Specifies that a gaming remote must be linked to the Roku Player to launch the application. If not, a dialog box is presented to the user. |	`requires_gaming_remote=1`
| `requires_mkv` | integer | Playing MKV files requires the use of a dynamically loaded library that is not part of the initially booted image. Therefore, an entry must be added to the manifest of any applications that require MKV support so that support is enabled when the channel is launched. | `requires_mkv=1`
| `network_not_required` | integer	| Set to 1 to specify the application does not require the network (such as the USB Media Player). This lets the user launch an application even if there is no network connection.	| `network_not_required=1`
| `bs_libs_required`	| string | Specifies the BrightScript libraries required for the application. | `bs_libs_required=roku_ads_lib`
| `usb_media_handler` | integer | Set to 1 to specify if the channel can be auto-launched when a USB device is inserted. | `usb_media_handler=1`

### DRM Attributes

| Attribute | Type   | Description | Sample manifest entry |
| --------- | ------ | ----------- | --------------------- |
| `requires_aaxs_drm` | integer | Downloads the required library to use Adobe Access DRM. | `requires_aaxs_drm=1`
| `requires_aaxs_version` | value | Specifies the version of Adobe Access to use. Roku currently supports version 1.0. | `requires_aaxs_version=1.0`
| `requires_verimatrix_drm` | integer | Downloads the required library to use Verimatrix DRM. | `requires_verimatrix_drm=1`
| `requires_verimatrix_version` | value | Specifies the version of Verimatrix DRM to use. Roku currently supports version 1.0. | `requires_verimatrix_version=1.0`

> See [Content Protection](/develop/specifications/content-protection.md) for implementation details.

### Special Purpose Attributes

| Attribute | Type   | Description | Sample manifest entry |
| --------- | ------ | ----------- | --------------------- |

| `rsg_version` | value | Set the SceneGraph [observer callback model](https://sdkdocs.roku.com/display/sdkdoc/Handling+Application+Events#HandlingApplicationEvents-ObserverCallbackModels). This defaults to `1.1` as of firmware v7.5 if it's not specified in the manifest. | `rsg_version=1.0`
| `automatic_audio_guide_disabled` | integer | Set to `1` to disable Audio Guide within a channel. | `automatic_audio_guide_disabled=1`
